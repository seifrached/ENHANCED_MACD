# ENHANCED_MACD
MY FAVORITE PERSONAL MACD is a customizable MetaTrader 4 indicator that computes a MACD line using two moving averages and a signal line (default period 14). It features a dynamic histogram whose color changes according to the momentum conditions, while optional displays let you hide or show the MACD line, signal line, and zero line.
